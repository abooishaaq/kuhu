# kuhu
a language for machine learning (sorta, kinda)

## features

- runs on gpus
- algebraic effects
- substructural types (maybe)
- just parser works :P

## roadmap

- basics
    - [x] parser
    - [ ] semantic analysis
    - [ ] codegen
    - [ ] ability to write a neural network
- what cool kids are doing
    - [ ] substructural types
    - [ ] algebraic effects
- gpu support
    - [ ] cuda
    - [ ] opencl
